### About the Experiment 


Probabilistic neural network (PNN) is closely related to Parzen window pdf estimator. A PNN consists of several sub-networks, each of which is a Parzen window pdf estimator for each of the classes.

The input nodes are the set of measurements.

The second layer consists of the Gaussian functions formed using the given set of data points as centers.

The third layer performs an average operation of the outputs from the second layer for each class.

The fourth layer performs a vote, selecting the largest value. The associated class label is then determined.
